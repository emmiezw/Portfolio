            <h3 id='s1' class='section'>INTRODUCTION</h3>     

            <p>In order to solve a problem I encountered during my research assistant work, I initiate researches, ideation and prototyping to envision a cross platform system for two distinguished user groups.
            <br><br>​In 2019, after taking SI582 Introduction to Interaction Design and SI649 Information Visualization, I reopened this project based on user research results and refined the prototypes.</p>
            
            <h2>EZLab solves the problem of the inefficiency in recruiting experiment volunteers.</h2>
            
            <p>It connects researchers and experiment volunteers with matching interests and automatic information exchanging. 
            <br><br>It has mobile for volunteers to browse, search and sign up for interested experiments. It has website for researchers to monitor, message volunteers and save more time for research work.</p>

            <h2>Talk to both stakeholders to understand the problems</h2>
            <p>I contacted 4 student researchers who took part in volunteer recruitment for research projects and 2 experiment volunteers of their ongoing projects. I conducted semi-structured interviews with researchers about the whole process and their feelings in different phases of managing the recruitment. I conducted interviews with volunteers about how they find out about these experiments and what are their key motivations in taking part in experiments.
            <br><br>An affinity map was coded to find key design opportunities. A journey map was used to locate design opportunities on users’ journey. </p>

            <h3 id='s3' class='section'>USER QUESTIONS</h3> 
                <p>Through an interactive design process, I was quickly moving between paper and digital <b>prototyping, testing </b>prototypes with users, and <b>co-creating</b> with and getting feedback from my advisor and engineers. From each iteration, I learned something valuable. Some helped me make small usability improvements, some helped me make major changes in my design direction.
            </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Initial iterations focused on flexible filtering</h2>
            <p>I began my early ideation based on the following scenarios:</p>
            <ul class='text-list'>
                <li>Which apps of mine use location data? (view by permission)</li>
                <li>Which apps of mine use my data for advertising? (view by purpose)</li>
                <li>What permission does this app request for and why?</li>
                <li>What are the unusual behaviors of my apps and what actions do I need to take?</li>
            </ul>
                
                <p>My initial prototypes were focused on a flexible data filtering so that users can manage their privacy data in different views: app, permission, purpose, and third-party library. With research, <b>I experimented with all different ways of organizing the data, from traditional filtering, faceted metadata, to search-as-filter.</b></p>
            
                <h4>Initial prototypes explored ways to efficiently filter and search for apps, permission, purposes, and third-party libraries.</h4>

                <h2>It is a great learning experiences with trust and growth!</h2>
                <p>I am so grateful that my team gave me so much trust. They give me individual projects, they always include me into product conversations, they support my proposals, they give me feedbacks, they help me know our customers better, and they always send me articles and videos that are inspiring to help me grow.
                <br>​<br>   ​
                Before my internship, I was a design student who gets intimidated to stand up and talk in meetings and class. Now I am a confident designer who believes my inputs is valuable and can defend my design decisions with reasonings.
