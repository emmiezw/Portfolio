            <p>Trimble Unity software platform offers a suite of applications and tools to support smart water management. However, user are finding current dashboard not effecitve in their day-to-day analysis, work management and in in-field inspection.

            <p>This is the new data model that DARPA and CMU will be proposing to Android: all Android developers need to specify the purpose of each privacy data use; on top of that, we can now parse out what third-party libraries are using what privacy data.<br><br> 
            Engineers have done the ground work. But now, here come the design challenges:<p>

            <h3 id='s3' class='section'>USER QUESTIONS</h3> 
                <p>Through an interactive design process, I was quickly moving between paper and digital <b>prototyping, testing </b>prototypes with users, and <b>co-creating</b> with and getting feedback from my advisor and engineers. From each iteration, I learned something valuable. Some helped me make small usability improvements, some helped me make major changes in my design direction.
            </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Initial iterations focused on flexible filtering</h2>
            <p>I began my early ideation based on the following scenarios:</p>
            <ul class='text-list'>
                <li>Which apps of mine use location data? (view by permission)</li>
                <li>Which apps of mine use my data for advertising? (view by purpose)</li>
                <li>What permission does this app request for and why?</li>
                <li>What are the unusual behaviors of my apps and what actions do I need to take?</li>
            </ul>
                
                <p>My initial prototypes were focused on a flexible data filtering so that users can manage their privacy data in different views: app, permission, purpose, and third-party library. With research, <b>I experimented with all different ways of organizing the data, from traditional filtering, faceted metadata, to search-as-filter.</b></p>

                <p>I am so grateful that my team gave me so much trust. They give me individual projects, they always include me into product conversations, they support my proposals, they give me feedbacks, they help me know our customers better, and they always send me articles and videos that are inspiring to help me grow.

                Before my internship, I was a design student who gets intimidated to stand up and talk in meetings and class. Now I am a confident designer who believes my inputs is valuable and can defend my design decisions with reasonings.
