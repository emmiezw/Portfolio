            <p>Food-e is an entrepreneur project based in University of Michigan. It is a communication platform that connects restaurant owners and customers with honest and private feedbacks.</p>

            <p>With sessions of mini testing and sprint reviews, we managed to grow deep understanding of both technical side and product design side of Food-e, and accumulated a huge product backlog. 
                <br><br>
                    During sprint planning, we estimate efforts and help determine acceptance criteria to help product owner prioritize features.
                <br><br>   
                    There are 5 key features implemented in our MVP: <b>Sign In/Sign Up, Explore Restaurants, Leave Feedbacks, Redeem Coupons, Edit Profile.</b> </p>

            <p>Figuring out these three “How Might We”s would be high impact for Food-e’s to meet its value proposition and obtain growth as an early stage entrepreneur product.

            <p><b>/Lack of Motivation</b>

<h3 id='s5' class='section'>CHALLENGE 1: INCENTIVIZE QUALITY FEEDBACK</h3>
<h2>How might we incentivize user to leave quality feedbacks?</h2>
<div class="project-img-div-med">
        <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/foode/p2_problem.jpg" alt="Problem 2">
</div>
<p><b>/User tends to finish fast with low quality</b><br>
    During user testing, we noticed that user tends to skip text fields at the end, which prevent the restaurants from getting quality, detailed feedbacks. Therefore, my design focused on nudging customers to put in more contents with improved usability. 
    <br><br>
    <b>/User is lack of internal drive</b><br>
        Another finding is that users are currently driven by external motivations, coupons. To create internal motivations of “helping the restaurant”, my design focused on highlighting that they are helping local business. Also, this is related to Challenge 3.</p>    

    <div class="space30px"></div>   
<h2>Improvement 1: Diversify incentives for different types of users</h2>
<p>I split the current “review” feature into two different features for two types of users. User can behave differently based on their thoughts on specific restaurants, and use these two features differently. </p>

<h2>Improvement 2: Improve core experiences for survey and suggestion</h2>
<p>MVP testing revealed a lot of usability issues in existing UI. When dividing review into “Survey” and “Suggestion”, I improved the core experience with these insights. 
<br><br>
    The main focus is to <b>show user status</b> and <b>highlight primary actions</b> with clear visual cues.</p>

<h3 id='s6' class='section'>CHALLENGE 2: GAIN LONG TERM ENGAGEMENT</h3>
<h2>How might we increase long-term user engagemnt?</h2>
<p>In the process of developing MVP, we tested out multiple engagement methods including badge system and level system. 
<br><br>
    However, after the final usability testing, we reached the conclusion that such social-focused incentives have small impacts on motivating our users because tall the reviews are private (visible only to user and the restaurant owner).
<br><br>   
    In order to create a more dynamic and long-lasting Food-e community that drives user to constantly leave new suggestions and pursue more than just coupons, I designed for two major improvements.</p>
<h2>Improvement 1: Create constant engagement with invitation feature</h2>

    <img class="project-img-med" src="../assets/foode/p3_concept.jpg" alt="Public Invitation Concept">

</div>
<div class="space30px"></div>  

<h2>Improvement 2: Make user feel more involved by communication features</h2>
<p>In the post-testing interview of MVP, users expressed that they don't know if their suggestion are adopted or not. Therefore, new design focuses on creating a mechanism that restaurant and user can communicate. Also, another insight came up that user might not use the coupon right after they receive it, the new design proposes two different flows for claiming coupon upon confirmation (under Profile Tab), and actually redeem coupon in store (under Wallet Tab). </p>
